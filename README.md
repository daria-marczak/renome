# Renome

## Technologies used in the project

Built with Gatsby CLI, the project uses ESLint and StyleLint for code quality. For styling I decided to go with Styled Components. When it comes to readability, the project is included with prettier. As for commits quality, I went with husky for firing pre-commit hooks and verifying if every file is correctly written.
